                        The number of immigrants to the State in the year to April 2018 is estimated to have increased by 6.7% from 84,600 to 90,300 while the number of emigrants declined over the same period, from 64,800 to 56,300 (-13.1%). These combined changes have resulted
                        in net inward migration for Ireland in 2018 of 34,000, the highest level of net inward migration since 2008. The combined effect of natural increase and positive net migration resulted in an overall increase in the population of
                        64,500 bringing the population estimate to 4.86 million in April 2018.

                        Energy use is usually linked to economic activity. A growing economy leads to more goods being produced, purchased, transported, and more disposable income for people spend on travel or on heating their homes. GDP is the most commonly used indicator for
                        economic growth but in Ireland GDP can be disproportionatly affected by the accounting of large multinationals. An alternative measure of economic activity developed by the Central Statistics Office is modified GNI. Due to lack
                        of data on the modified GNI the standard GNI is shown above. There was a 3% increase in Modified Gross National Income (GNI*) at current market prices from 2016-2017, rising from €175.8bn to €181.2bn compared to a 5% increase in
                        GNI

                        Looking at final energy spit by sector, transport has by far the largest share, accounting for 43% of final energy demand in 2017. Transport has been the sector that is most sensitive to the economy. Transport energy demand experienced the greatest reduction
                        after the 2009 recession and has seen the greatest increase since 2012.<br> The next largest sources of energy demand are households and industry. They accounted for 21% and 22% of final energy use respectively
                        in 2017.

                        Final Energy Consumption peaked in 2008 and declined between 2008 and 2014, due to the recession. Following the recovery in the economy, primary energy returned to growth in 2015 and 2016 but remained flat in 2017.<br> Oil continues
                        to be the dominant energy source and the dominant fuel of Total Final Consumption (TFC). It made up 57.5% of TFC in 2017. Final consumption of oil increased by 0.9% in 2017 (0.5% increase in primary consumption). 2017 was a milder
                        year than 2016 which resulted in lower oil use in the residential and commercial sectors. Oil is mostly used for transport, followed by heating.<br> Electricity is the next largest energy source comsumed at 19% of TFC. Most of
                        this electricity is generated by natural gas. (Natural gas accounted for 51% of energy inputs to electricity generation in 2017. This is accoutned for under primary energy as opposed final consumption shown in the graphs above.)<br>                        Total renewable energy increased by 19% during 2017. Hydro and wind increased by 1.6% and 21% respectively. Biomass use also increased by 13.2%. Renewable energy accounted for 9.3% of primary energy in 2017, up from 7.9% in 2016.

                        Any company or body within the EU that emits a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions is included in the Emissions Trading System, commonly known as the ETS for short. This includes large industries, electricity generators, and the aviation industry.

                            <p>
                                The ETS ensures that all these companies will collectively reduce their emissions by 21% by 2020 compared to 2005. Companies in the ETS were responsible for 28% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions In 2017.

                    <h4>Emissions from homes, small businesses and farms (Non-ETS)</h4>
                    <p>All greenhouse gas emissions that are not from companies in the ETS are called non-ETS emissions. Non-ETS emissions include greenhouse gas emissions from homes, cars, small businesses and agriculture. These are often collectively called
                        the non-ETS sector.
                    </p>
                    <p>The biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland is CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels in the non-ETS sector, for example in homes and cars. These made up 35% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland in 2017,
                        and 49% of all non-ETS greenhouse gas emissions. Other greenhouse gas emissions in the non-ETS sector, for instance from refrigeration or from landfill gases, made up 4% of all greenhouse gas emissions, or 5% of non-ETS emissions
                        in 2017. Non-ETS emissions are important because each country in the EU has mandatory targets to reduce non-ETS emissions in 2020 and 2030. Ireland's target for 2020 is for non-ETS emissions to be 20% lower than they were in 2005.
                        Currently we are on track to be just 1% lower.

                    <h4>Large share of agriculture</h4>
                    <p>
                        Ireland is unusual compared to other EU countries because greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture make up a much larger share of our emissions. In 2017 agriculture was responsible for 33% of all greenhouse gas emissions, and for 46% of all non-ETS greenhouse
                        gas emissions.

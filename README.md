# Energy Data Dashboard

Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project 2 - Code Institute 

This is a dashboard that allows users to see a breakdown of Ireland's Final Energy Consumption (Total Final Consumption [TFC]) 
by sector and by fuel type, as well as a breakdown of Ireland's Greenhouse gas/CO2 emissions.
The dashboard is primarily aimed at academics, researchers and professionals working in the energy industry or concerned with
energy policy but the data should be digestible to any readers with some knowledge of energy and greenhouse gas metrics.
